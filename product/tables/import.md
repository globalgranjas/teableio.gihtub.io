  table. This article will guide you through the process of importing tabular
  files into a data table.

# Import

> Tips: Currently, Excel files are limited to a size of 5MB or smaller. If you need to import a large amount of data, it is recommended to use CSV or TSV file formats instead.

## Import new Table

### Step One: Click on the plus (+) button on the left-hand menu to select the file type for importing

### Step Two：Set filed fype

After uploading the file, Teable will automatically predict the data types for the matching fields based on the first 5000 rows of data. However, you can also manually adjust the field types according to your needs.

### Step Three：Import success

> Note: During the import process, please refrain from deleting columns or changing column types until you receive a successful or failed notification. Making such changes during the import process may affect the import results.

Click on the "Import" button, and Teable will initiate the data import process in the background asynchronously. Once the import is complete, you will receive a notification indicating whether it was successful or failed, including the reason for any failures.

## Inplace Import

Teable also supports inplace import for existing data tables. You can choose to append new data to the existing table without affecting the existing data. This allows you to easily update and expand your existing data table without having to reimport the entire dataset.

### Step One: Click on the "Data Tables" option, select "Import Data," and choose the file type of the file you want to import

### Step Two: Choose the field mapping for the import

After uploading the corresponding file you wish to import, select the columns from the file that you want to map to the fields in the data table. Once you have set up the mappings, click on the "Import" button to initiate the import process.
