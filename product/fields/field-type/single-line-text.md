# Single line text

Single line text fields are designed for inputting brief text and are a fundamental field type commonly used in databases. They are ideal for adding short text values in a table.

Users can enter text by clicking on a cell and typing directly. Standard text editing operations such as cut, copy, and paste are also supported.

Entered text can be utilized for filtering and sorting purposes. It supports text processing functions for extraction among other operations. Moreover, users can easily set default values for text fields to minimize repetitive input.
