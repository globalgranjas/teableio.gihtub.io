# Multiple line text

Multi-line text fields allow for the input of text content of unlimited length across multiple paragraphs.

Unlike single-line text fields, multi-line text fields can accommodate paragraphed article-style content. Users can either type directly or paste text into the field. Once a cell is selected, the multi-line text will automatically wrap to fit the column width, and users can also insert line breaks manually using Shift+Enter.

#### Considerations

Multi-line text fields only support text display formats and do not support the display formats for URLs, emails, or phone numbers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* The translation aims to convey the original meaning while ensuring natural and fluent English expression.
* The use of "article-style content" helps clarify the type of text suitable for multi-line fields, avoiding a direct translation of "文章式内容."
* "Wrap to fit the column width" is a more idiomatic way to describe the automatic adjustment of text to the available space.
* The translation of the note about what is not supported by multi-line text fields is straightforward and clear, maintaining the original intent without direct translation.
