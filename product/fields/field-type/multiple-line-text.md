# Multiple line text

Multiple text fields allow for the input of text content of unlimited length across multiple paragraphs.

Unlike single line text fields, multiple line text fields can accommodate paragraphed article-style content. Users can either type directly or paste text into the field. Once a cell is selected, the multiple line text will automatically wrap to fit the column width, and users can also insert line breaks manually using Shift+Enter.

#### Considerations

Multiple line text fields only support text display formats and do not support the display formats for URLs, emails, or phone numbers.
